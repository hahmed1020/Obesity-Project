      A data-driven look at how daily habits influence obesity and overall health.

      <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Obesity is a growing global health issue, associated with increased risks of chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. 
        It’s a complex condition influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions, demographic traits, and everyday lifestyle choices.
        This project investigates how factors like eating habits, hydration, physical activity, screen time, and transportation methods contribute to obesity risk.
        Our goal is to use interactive visualizations and data-driven analysis to uncover patterns that highlight the most influential behaviors. 
        These insights can support better personal decisions and more effective public health strategies.

      <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        We use the 
        <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition" target="_blank">
          Obesity Prediction Dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
        The dataset contains 2,111 individuals and 17 features, including one target variable 
        (<code>Obesity_level</code>) that classifies individuals into categories from underweight to obesity type III.
      </p>
      <p>
        The features are grouped into the following categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> <code>Gender</code>, <code>Age</code>, <code>Height</code>, <code>Weight</code> – baseline characteristics crucial for BMI calculation.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic & Background Factors:</strong> <code>family_history</code> (overweight in family), <code>SCC</code> (monitors calorie intake).</li>
        <li><strong>Lifestyle & Behavioral Habits:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Eating habits:</strong> <code>FAVC</code> (high-calorie foods), <code>FCVC</code> (vegetable intake), <code>NCP</code> (meal frequency), <code>CAEC</code> (snacking).</li>
            <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> <code>CH2O</code> (daily water intake).</li>
            <li><strong>Activity:</strong> <code>FAF</code> (physical activity), <code>TUE</code> (screen time), <code>MTRANS</code> (transportation type).</li>
            <li><strong>Other factors:</strong> <code>SMOKE</code> (smoking), <code>CALC</code> (alcohol consumption).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By exploring how these features relate to obesity levels, we aim to identify actionable insights and build a deeper understanding of the behavioral factors behind weight gain.

      <h2>Summary & Future Work</h2>
      <p> Our analysis highlights how daily habits such as meal frequency, snacking behavior, and physical activity levels are associated with varying obesity levels. The boxplot visualizations show a clear trend where higher obesity categories correspond to increased body weight, while the D3 chart reveals that individuals who "sometimes" snack between meals are the most likely to fall into higher obesity levels. This suggests that irregular or frequent snacking may play a role in weight gain over time. Additionally, visual patterns between height, weight, and age suggest that while these factors contribute, lifestyle behaviors carry significant weight in determining obesity risk.</p>
      <p> Future work could include applying machine learning techniques to build a predictive model of obesity risk based on lifestyle features. The dataset could also be further segmented to explore whether specific trends differ across gender or age groups. These extensions would enhance our ability to personalize health recommendations and guide more targeted public health interventions. </p>
